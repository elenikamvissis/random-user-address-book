# Random user address book

This is a simple application for fetching random users and displaying their contact information. The application is written using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). For styling I have used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The API fetches data from the [Random User Generator API.](https://randomuser.me/)

## Run the application

Download the project, then run the development server:

```
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view application in the browser.
